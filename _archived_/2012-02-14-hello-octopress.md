To begin with, this is my first Octopress post after struggling for a whole day. Congratulations to myself!

Actually, I used to be a Wordpress fan like you then I took an arrow in the knee. :p

As it says on the Octopress Officinal website, Octopress is really really **AWESOME**!!! I love it in half a second though I'm not a real *hacker*.

Someone said that the first post should not be too long. So... that's all.
