> Not a lot happened this year. Said no one ever.

A lot did happen this year. Like every year. I always belive that life is forever in motion, always changing and growing. At the end of the year, I write this post for nobody but myself to reflect on everything that happened and to predict, imagine and set goals for 2015 and beyond.

From Feburary to June, I worked on my graduation research in Wuxi. It's really a great place to live in and all my friends are very nice there. The photo above is of the students and workers in Wuxi IoT Research Center after the spring tour near Taihu Lake.

After then, I returned to Xi'an and got my bachelor's degree in June. It's one of the biggest events for me this year because I have to say goodbye to these old sports who I lived with for four years. Four years is actually not a short time but it's really too short like a flicker when the moment is coming. Most of the guys got jobs all around the country and everyone has a new plan for their future. It may be the last time we can be together in our life but I still wish that all of us can cherish the friendship and memory of our youngth. Miss you all and happy new year, my friends!

After the long goodbye, I started my summer trip from Sichuan to Wuhan with Yuze for two weeks. Hongya cave, Jiefang Monument, Chunxi Road, Dujiang Weir, Qingcheng Mountain, Jiuzhai Valley... It's really a fantastic travel. As for the photo above, instead of the regular travel-graph, I picked this blurred one because it is taken automatically (I don't even know when it was taken or how it was blurred). Just like our trip, it's totally marvellous! Cool, uh?

This photo was taken by Ms Dai (Xiaoting's mother) on Mid-Autumn Festival night. From left to right: I, Yiran, Yingyi, Xiaoting. We four first met on the Christmas night two years ago and now we are best friends. This year is also a big year for them because they were preparing for their graduation. Yiran would go abroad for her further study, Yingyi & Xiaoting just finished their graduate student entrance examination. In any case, The greatest gift of life is friendship, and I have received it.

In September, I began my PhD career and I met a bunch of new friends.

Thatâ€™s it! Well, not all of it. Anyway, Everyone, have a Happy New Year!
