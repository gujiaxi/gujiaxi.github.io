# Life

Before the winter holiday, I was tidying up things and preparing for
leaving Wuxi. At that time, I attend to the annual meeting of the
company and say goodbye to my friends in Wuxi.

At the end of January, I was in my hometown Changshu. I have a lot of
fun with my old friends. Most of the time, we play cards.

During February and March, I stayed USTC (University of Science and
Technology of China) in Hefei on some research work with
Prof. Zhang.

At the end of March, I went to Tsinghua University and stayed in
Beijing for the rest of the time. I met my best friend in Beijing. He
was planning to leave Beijing for Shanghai then.

At the beginning of May, I went to Xi'an for my PhD opening report so
I finally met my college friends in school. Right after the day I
arrived in Xi'an, I flied to Shanghai for TURC 2017 conference with my
college friends.

In August, I went Changshu for attending the wedding of my another
best friend. I met some of my high school classmates there and we had
not met for a very long time since we graduated from high school.

In November, I went Changshu for attending the wedding of my
brother. The wedding follows the traditional customs of Changshu so
it is very impressive.

Last thing I want to mentioned is that my paper was accepted by
INFOCOM 2018 this year. I was very excited when I received the
notification on the early morning of November 27th.

# Games

My life of game is quite different than usual in this year. I played
Dota 2 only few times in the very begging of this year and after that
I almost neither played the game myself nor watched any Dota related
(live) videos. Instead, I played games on Nintendo Switch most of the
time. Surely, I am always a retro game enthusiast. I spent some time
on old game consoles or game emulators. The games I played this year
are as follows.
