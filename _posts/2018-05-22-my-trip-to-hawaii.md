## Prologue

Last month, I attended IEEE INFOCOM 2018 in Hawaii. It is really a
fantastic experience so I want to write something about this trip
here.

## Go to Honolulu

My flight from Beijing to Honolulu departed at 01:00 on April 15
(GMT+8) and arrives at 16:25 on April 14 (HST). At the first sight of
the island from the view on the plane, it is covered with green plants
and there are rugged terrains everywhere. However, skyscrapers
gathered in busy areas shows the modernity of this island.

## Waikiki Beach

The hotel is situated right by the Waikiki beach and the scenery
outside is very beautiful.

## Hanauma Bay

Hanauma Bay is situated in the south-east corner of Oahu island. It
is not a large place but a good place for snorkeling.

## Diamond Head

Diamond Head is like a mountain but it is actually a volcanic tuff
cone. It takes not much time to reach the top of it. During the
hiking, I really feel the unique tropical climate. It is hot and wet
but meanwhile it showers from time to time.

## Iolani Palace

Iolani Palace is a great place to know the history of Kingdom of
Hawaii.

## Shopping & Beach Walk

Oahu island is not only a tourist resort but also a shopping paradise.

## Pearl Harbor

Pearl Harbor is an important historic site of World War II. It may be
the most famous and popular site for both American and
foreigners. There is a long queue even though I get there early before
the site is open.

## Back to China

My flight from Honolulu to Beijing departs at 23:30 on April 19
(HST) and arrives at 16:25 on April 21 (GMT+8).

## Epilogue

It was my first time to USA though Hawaii is far away from the
Mainland United States. I also do all my travel arrangements on my
own. As always, when I am on a trip, especially to one unacquainted
place, what I pursue and cherish is that the lifestyle of the local or
the core spirit of the place. And what I like to do is to behave like
a local and integrate myself into the local culture and
surroundings. When it comes to Hawaii, I feel it is a palce with dual
identity, that is, a mixture of the Aloha spirit from the old times
and the relatively modern US spirit. In my feelings, Aloha spirit is
passion, courage, etc, while US spirit is confidence, equality,
liberty, etc. Finally, as a conclusion, I make a list of how I feel
different when I was in Hawaii:

- The weather is really changeable in the island but umbrellas are
  rare in the streets. I guess the reasons are that the rain normally
  only lasts for a short time and then the sunshine will be enough to
  keep your clothes dry.
- More than once, I pass by Apple Stores and find that there are all
  kinds of people in the stores, including cleaners and vagrants
  without decent clothes, watching videos on Youtube or listening to
  music on Soundcloud.
- In comparison with eating in China, meals cost much there but the
  price of fast food such as McDonald's seems the same
  internationally.
